# web-scraping 🕷️ 🥷 🕵️‍♂️ 
This is a web scraping training exercise, a work in progress which main goal is learning by doing.
The scraped web is http://www.buscocolegio.com, a spanish website that searches and recommends schools based on a variety of filters.

The total scraped data is 40+ datapoints from every school (when available) as diverse as:
- main (name, logo...)
- location (street, postal code, city, lat, long...)
- contact (telephone number, fax, mail, website, facebook, instagram, twitter...)
- others (number of students, courses, sports, activities, facilities, exams, average marks, reviews, comments...)

All the data is collected and organized in a json.
